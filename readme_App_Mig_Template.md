> A comprehensive, battle-tested template for planning and executing individual application migrations to AWS Cloud.

## üìã Overview

This template provides a systematic approach to cloud migration planning, derived from real-world enterprise migrations. It addresses the common failure points in migration projects through structured planning, risk assessment, and stakeholder communication.

### Why Use This Template?

- **Proven Framework**: Based on successful migration of many applications/Infrastructure across 6+ years
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: From technical assessment to post-migration optimization
- **Risk Management**: Built-in risk identification and mitigation strategies
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Clear communication plans and sign-off processes
- **Measurable Success**: Specific KPIs and acceptance criteria

## How to Use This Template

1. **Fork or clone the repository** to your workspace. or **Download** the template file: [`application-migration-template.md`](https://github.com/asiandevs/cloud_services/blob/main/application-migration-template.md)
2. **Rename the template file** to reflect your project, e.g., `CustomerPortal_MigrationPlan.md`.  
3. **Replace sample values** with your project-specific details:  
   - Application name, IDs, and project contacts  
   - Current infrastructure, servers, and database configurations  
   - Target cloud architecture (AWS/Azure/Other)  
   - Timeline, milestones, and resource allocation  
4. **Update tables, charts, and checklists** as per your project requirements.  
5. **Share with stakeholders** for review and approval. Use version control to track changes.  
6. **Maintain the document** throughout migration and post-migration phases.  
7. **Archive final version** for future reference and lessons learned.
